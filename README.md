# Software Engineering Bootcamp Syllabus

_postscript: this document is not AI generated_ and **yet to be completed**.

The first section consists of multiple chapters built around the [3-tier software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture) containing:

0. [requirements engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering) and pre-requisites refreshers
1. controller
2. service
3. repository
4. cross-cutting concerns
5. testing
6. security
7. building & deployment
8. wrapping things up

There are many overlapping concepts that do not belong to a specific chapter but will be discussed throughout either the instructions themselves or home-projects, including but not limited to:

- feeling at home with the terminal
- 12 factor app
- collaboration within software development (git best practices)
- software engineer toolings

## 0. requirements engineering and problem description

we will talk about a real-world problem, design a system and continue implementing during the next chapters.

## 1. Controller
- inter-service communication (HTTP, gRPC)

## 2. Service

## 3. Repository

- common patterns for resource serving such as pagination

## 4. Cross-cutting concerns

observability
- logging
- tracing
- metrics


## 5. Testing

- TDD, thinking in assertions
- unit tests, integrations tests, E2E tests


## 6. Security

- foundations of cybersecurity
- authentication & authorization
- resource access control list (ACL): RBAC, ABAC, PBAC
- users' personally identifiable information ([PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data))

## 7. Building & deployment

- docker/docker compose and best practices
- writing Dockerfiles correctly
- CI/CD continues integration/ continues delivery
- deployment within Github Actions
- zero-downtime deployments

## 8. Wrapping things up

- discuss what we learned so far
- software development life cycle (SDLC)



## Where to go from here?
